### Extra Credit

1. Add some pseudoclasses to the page to change colors as you hover over different elements.



2. Create a separate `index.html` and `styles.css` in a separate folder and do your best to copy this webpage: https://lambdaschool.com/
	
    * You can copy the images by right clicking and selecting "Copy Image Address".  Paste the address into an `<img>` tag's `src` attribute.
    * You can achieve translucent backgrounds with `rgba` colors. Example: `rgba(200, 200, 200, .5)` The `.5` (alpha value) controls the transparency.
